          At the heart of our platform, we have a state-of-the-art Natural
          Language Processing (NLP) system that parses and understands the
          structure and semantics of the text you submit. Once your text is
          processed, our system cross-references it with a vast database of
          verified information to identify claims or statements that might need
          further verification. We also integrate with the ClaimBuster API, a
          leading tool in the fact-checking domain. This integration ensures
          that the text is checked against a wide array of sources and databases
          for utmost accuracy.{" "}

          After the analysis is complete, our platform highlights the text that
          might be inaccurate or contentious, providing you the results by
          verifying with relevant sources or references for each identified
          claim. It's worth noting that while our system is designed to be
          highly accurate, no fact-checking tool can guarantee 100% accuracy.
